          Where did the Acadians come from?
        </h1>
        <p className='text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-200'>
          This question led me to begin a search for answers that continues
          today. Fortunately, there is a cultural interest in the Southwest
          Louisiana locale which has led to the availability of many written
          resources which a person interested in tracing his family may use. The
          existence of useful records is primarily attributable to the strong,
          Catholic ties practiced by Acadians for many years. Milestones like
          birth records, baptismal records, marriage records, and the inevitable
          death records continue to be maintained by the parish in which the
          catholic resides, independent of secular requirements. The coat of
          arms shown to the left is from documentation found at the Rietsap
          Armorial General. It should be noted here that the word Parish is a
          geographical designation equivalent to a County. Louisiana is the only
          state of the 50 United States which has this system. This practice
          began many years ago and continues to this day.

          Cormier Heritage
        </h1>
        <p className='text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-200'>
          The earliest Cormier to migrate to New France, also called Acadie, was
          Robert Cormier. Robert was born in La Rochelle, France, in 1610. he,
          his wife Marie Peraud, and their son Thomas boarded an oceangoing ship
          and traveled to Port Royale, which was part of present-day Canada. The
          agreed-to fare for the water journey was 3 years of carpentry duties
          for the ship owner, who owned a business at the port of Royale. Robert
          and many immigrants were happy to make the journey in search of a
          better life. Generation 2 included Thomas, who traveled to the new
          world with his father, Robert, and mother Marie peraud. Thomas
          Cormier, according to the National Archives in Washington, D.C., is
          the father of all Cormiers in the North American continent.

          Louisiana Cormiers
        </h1>
        <p className='text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-200'>
          Generation 3 was carried by Pierre Cormier, and Generation 4 was
          continued by another Pierre. Generation 5 was under the leadership of
          Michael Cormier, the Acadian from whom the Louisiana Cormiers are
          descended. He survived the Grand Derangement, the forced migration
          imposed upon the Acadians by the English King. There was another
          Pierre, as the patriarch of generation 6. Generation 7 was continued
          by Maximilien, generation 8 Narcisse, generation 9 Pierre, generation
          10 had Willie. The Louisiana Cormier family continues to grow,
          including the current generation, generation 14. This brief record of
          Cormier lineage should help to give an idea of the history that is
          available to those who are interested in that kind of thing, and it is
          my belief that some of the family characteristics shown in photos like
          those below, carry forward from generation to generation, along with
          the name. We'll continue to add new photos to the album, as we can.
